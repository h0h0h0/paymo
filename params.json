{"body":"# Paymo API Wrapper for Python\r\n\r\nThis module wraps the Paymo API. It has some nice features:\r\n\r\n  - the API methods are dynamically generated using reflection, \r\n    so any future API method will be automatically added\r\n  - the calls are identical, but you can omit the credentials \r\n    for convenience\r\n  - the docstrings for the methods are also generated using\r\n    reflection, so you can `help(paymo.group.method)`\r\n\r\n## What is Paymo?\r\n\r\nPaymo is cloud based application for tracking your time and invoice\r\nyour clients. Before I started using it, I was constantly forgetting\r\nto bill some customer for some of my time, so it rocks my universe. \r\nIt is a must-have for freelancers, contractors and consulting business.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give it a check, use my referal link (shameless plug):\r\n\r\n  - [http://www.paymo.biz/](http://www.paymo.biz/?utm_source=7b76bTP02Xee)\r\n\r\nIt is free for 1 user and if you are using Google Apps for your domain,\r\nit integrates very nicely.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nIt is in the chese shop, so just easy_instal or pip it.\r\n\r\n    pip install paymo\r\n    \r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nJust fork it and send pull requests.\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\nJust initialize the API with your credentials and call tha API\r\nmethods as standard python methods feeding parameters by name.\r\n\r\nMethod and parameter names are the same documented at:\r\n\r\n  - [http://api.paymo.biz/docs/](http://api.paymo.biz/docs/)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    >>> from paymoapi import PaymoAPI\r\n    >>> paymo = PaymoAPI('my-paymo-api-key', 'my-username', 'my-password')\r\n    >>> # Now you can call apy methods like native python methods\r\n    >>> paymo.users.getList()\r\n    {u'status': u'ok',\r\n     u'users': {u'user': [{u'active': 1,\r\n                           u'id': u'65535',\r\n                           u'realname': u'Enoch Root',\r\n                           u'username': u'root@eruditorum.org'},\r\n                          {u'active': 1,\r\n                           u'id': u'65534',\r\n                           u'realname': u'Thomas A.
